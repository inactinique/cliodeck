	abstract = {According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.},

	abstract = {The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has raised questions about the relevance of history education. In response, this paper examines the limitations of AI, particularly its large language models (LLMs), and highlights the enduring educational value of historical thinking. While AI can generate plausible narratives, it often lacks empirical accuracy, interpretive depth, and contextual sensitivity—qualities essential to the discipline of history. Reaffirming history’s epistemological foundations, the article argues that the rise of AI amplifies rather than reduces the importance of historical literacy. Historical literacy equips students to interrogate sources, evaluate bias, and navigate content increasingly shaped by algorithms. To support this, four pedagogical approaches are proposed: fostering critical engagement of AI-generated content, using AI tools to support source reading, developing AI literacy through inquirybased projects, and revisiting historical source work with renewed disciplinary purpose. Cultivating critical, empathetic, and contextually grounded historical thinking is presented as an essential set of skills for preparing students to navigate an AI-mediated world.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the integration of artificial intelligence into history education, specifically through the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Azevedo, with 25 years of experience in teaching history, elaborates on how technology can enhance human capabilities rather than replace educators.

Azevedo addresses the historical resistance of educators to technology due to insufficient training, and how the recent pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital tools in education. He introduces an educational activity called "Letters to the Past," where students write letters to historical figures after studying a specific period, such as the French Revolution. This activity enables students to interact with history in a fun and practical manner.

With the introduction of ChatGPT, Azevedo has been able to scale this activity, allowing for personalized responses from historical figures to student letters, thereby increasing interaction and enriching the learning experience. ChatGPT also assists in collectively analyzing the letters to identify common themes and conceptual errors like anachronisms.

The document concludes by highlighting the transformative potential of AI in education and invites educators and technology enthusiasts to explore AI tools in their teaching practices, share experiences, and discover new possibilities for enhancing educational processes.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the popularity of AI technologies in our everyday life, researchers have begun to discuss an emerging term “AI literacy”. However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today’s AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students’ AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students’ AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today’s growing AI economy.},

No one has thought more about these issues--or has more interesting things to say about them' Bill GatesWhether we like it or not, the AI revolution is coming to education. In Brave New Words, Salman Khan, the visionary behind Khan Academy, explores how artificial intelligence and GPT technology will transform learning, offering a roadmap for teachers, parents, and students to navigate this exciting (and sometimes intimidating) new world.A pioneer in the world of education technology, Khan explains the ins and outs of these cutting-edge tools and how they will forever change the way we learn and teach. Rather than approaching the ChatGPT revolution with white-knuckled fear, Khan wants parents and teachers to embrace AI and adapt to it (while acknowledging its imperfections and limitations). He emphasizes that embracing AI in education is not about replacing human interaction but enhancing it, so that every student can complement the work they're already doing in profoundly new and creative ways, to personalize learning, adapt assessments, and support success in the classroom, preparing students for an increasingly digital future.But Brave New Words is not just about technology - it's about what this technology means for our society, and the practical implications for administrators, guidance counsellors, and hiring managers who can harness the power of AI in education and the workplace. Khan also delves into the ethical and social implications of AI and GPT, offering thoughtful insights into how we can use these tools to build a more accessible education system for students around the world},

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant tool in Holocaust education, enabling immersive experiences, interactive storytelling, and the preservation of survivor testimonies. This study presents the first empirical comparison of four generations of Holocaust descendants’ perceptions of AI-generated Holocaust content. Findings reveal a Generational Trust Gap: while the first and second generations prioritize emotional authenticity and remain skeptical of AI, third- and fourth-generation participants show greater trust in digital platforms and AI-driven tools for Holocaust education. This shift does not reflect disengagement, but rather a transformation in learning practices. The fourth generation’s use of AI-powered tools, including short-form content on TikTok and Instagram Reels, represents a new mode of Holocaust engagement, but also raises ethical concerns for gamification and the trivialization of trauma. This study uniquely maps these concerns across generations, demonstrating they are ethically grounded. This study advocates for a hybrid model that integrates AI with human storytelling and scholarly oversight to ensure responsible Holocaust education.},

The study employs the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) as its development framework. The feasibility test results indicate high validity, with material experts scoring the media at 91.60\% and media experts at 88.4\%. Testing with a small group yielded a validity score of 62.6\%, while medium and large group tests recorded scores of 82\% and 90.74\%, respectively, all categorized as valid or very valid. Effectiveness was measured using pre-test and post-test comparisons, where the average pre-test score was 60.18\%, increasing to 82.93\% in the post-test. Learning success was determined by students achieving a minimum score of 78, with a success rate of 70\%. The findings demonstrate that AI-based 3D video learning media are highly feasible and effective in enhancing history learning outcomes for Class XI Social Studies students at MAN 3 Medan.

Drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS), we provide a detailed examination of the scholarly work carried out by several data scientists around the use of ‘deep learning’ to predict aspects of educational performance. This approach draws attention to relations between various (problematic) units of analysis: flawed data, partially incomprehensible computational methods, narrow forms of educational’ knowledge baked into the online environments, and a reductionist discourse of data science with evident economic ramifications.

Drawing from new materialist and Black feminist thought, we consider how learning analytics platforms for writing are animated by and through entanglements of algorithmic reasoning, state standards and assessments, embodied literacy practices, and sociopolitical relations. We do a close reading of research and development documents associated with Essay Helper, a machine learning platform that provides formative feedback on student writing based on standards-aligned rubrics and training data. In particular, we consider the performative acts of the algorithm in the Essay Helper platform – both in the ways that reconstitutes material-discursive relations of difference, and its implications for transactions of teaching and learning. We argue that, through these processes, the algorithms function as racializing assemblages, and conclude by suggesting pathways toward alternative futures that reconfigure the sociopolitical relations the platform inherits.},

The article is based on an EU scoping study [Berendt, B., A. Littlejohn, P. Kern, P. Mitros, X. Shacklock, and M. Blakemore. 2017. Big Data for Monitoring Educational Systems. Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union. https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/]. The study takes into account the potential for AI and ‘Big Data’ to provide more effective monitoring of the education system in real-time, but also considers the implications for fundamental human rights and freedoms of both teachers and learners. The analysis highlights a need to balance the benefits and risks as AI tools are developed, marketed and deployed. We conclude with a call to embed consideration of the benefits and risks of AI in education as technology tools into the development, marketing and deployment of these tools. There are questions around who – which body or organisation – should take responsibility for regulating AI in education, particularly since AI impacts not only data protection and privacy, but on fundamental rights in general. Given AI’s global impact, it should be regulated at a trans-national level, with a global organisation such as the UN taking on this role.},

While media and policy discourse often portray China’s AI development in terms of a unified national strategy, and a burgeoning geopolitical contestation for future global dominance, this analysis will suggest a more nuanced internal complexity, involving differing regional networks and international corporate activity. The first section considers two key policy documents published by the central Chinese government, which are shown to implicate educational institutions as influential actors in national and regional strategies for AI development, with a significant role in plans to train domestic expertise. The second section outlines three prominent private education companies: New Oriental Group, Tomorrow Advancing Life (TAL), and Squirrel AI. These companies are selected to represent important aspects of China’s development of educational AI applications, including the influence of a well-established private education sector, and a growing interest in international corporate activity. The paper concludes with the suggestion that while central government policy reserves a significant role for education in the national AI strategy, the private sector is utilising favourable political conditions to rapidly develop educational applications and markets.},

New forms of datafication and automation enable governments and other powerful stakeholders to draw from the past to construct images of educational futures in order to steer the present. This paper examines the competing conceptions of time and temporality that AI posits for policy and practice when used to anticipate educational futures. We argue that most educational futures are already delineated, and machinic expressions of time are the chronologies, habits, and memories that the educated subject inhabits rather than produces. If resetting educational habits and memories can be an alternative to algorithmic anticipations of education then we believe, paradoxically, that machines may help to reset them by accelerating them.},

This article looks at AI teachers’ history, some key cases, potential and benefits, and concerns and challenges associated with their use in classrooms. Overcoming teachers’ shortage, flexibility, transparency, unbiasedness, and improving students’ motivation were some of their key benefits; while being untested and unreliable, cost, need for specific infrastructure and technical expertise, resistance to change, ethical issues, and fears of dehumanizing and desensitizing students were the main concerns and challenges. We suggest co-teaching with AI teachers using four different approaches. Through them, AI teachers and human teachers can work together in classrooms to maximize the effectiveness of the teaching-learning process.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have a major social impact in the coming years, affecting today’s professions and our daily routines. In the short-term, education is one of the most impacted areas. The autonomous decision making that can be achieved with tools based on AI implies that some of the traditional methodologies associated with the fundamentals of the learning process in students, must be reviewed. Consequently, the role of teachers in the classroom may change, as they will have to deal with such AI tools performing parts of their work, and with students making a common use of them. In this scope, the AI in Education (AIEd) community agrees on the key relevance of developing AI literacies to train teachers and students of all educational levels in the fundamentals of this new technological discipline, so they can understand how these tools based on AI work and pilot the adaptation in an informed way. This implies teaching students about the fundamentals of topics like perception, representation, reasoning, learning, and the impact of AI, with the aim of delivering a solid formation in this area. To support them, formal teaching and learning resources must be developed and tested with students, properly adapted to different educational levels. The main contribution of this proposal lies in the presentation of the Robobo Project, a technological tool based on intelligent robotics that supports such formal AI literacy training for a wide range of ages, from secondary school to higher education. The core part of this paper is focused on showing the possibilities the Robobo Project offers to teachers in a simple way, and how it can be adapted to different levels and skills, leading to a long-term educational proposal. Validation results that support the feasibility of this technology in the education about AI, obtained with students and teachers in different educational levels during a period of six years, are presented and discussed.},

By doing so, we seek to uncover the prominent keywords associated with AI-enabled pedagogical adaptation research in each decade, due to the discipline’s dynamism. By examining the major research themes and historical trends from 2000 to 2019, we demonstrate that, as advanced technologies in education evolve over time, some areas of research topics seem have stood the test of time, while some others have experienced peaks and valleys. More importantly, our analysis highlights the paradigm shifts and emergent trends that are gaining prominence in the field of educational research. For instance, the results suggest the decline in conventional tech-enabled instructional design research and the flourishing of student profiling models and learning analytics.

The proposed model satisfies the data required for different teaching methods/ subjects based on curriculum and student requirements. The data integration from different sources is performed using checksum assessment. The checksum assessment for data provides precise assimilation and content-related data-to-visual representation. In this representation, the checksums are verified for their linearity, wherein the saturation/ threshold factors are identified, and data integration is recommended. This recommendation is performed as the decision-making for preventing paused representation in live teaching sessions. The checksums are used for content coherency and complete data representations to prevent time lags in teaching. The proposed model’s performance is verified through data handling rate, integration ratio, pause time, representation time lag, and failures.},

	abstract = {This study delves into the burgeoning intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and art history education, an area that has been relatively unexplored. The research focuses on how AI art generators impact learning outcomes in art history for both undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in Ancient Art courses, covering eras from ancient Mesopotamia to the fall of Rome. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study analyzes AI-generated artworks, reflective essays, and survey responses to assess how these generative tools influence students’ comprehension, engagement, and creative interpretation of historical artworks. The study reveals that the use of AI tools in art history not only enhances students’ understanding of artistic concepts but also fosters a deeper, more nuanced appreciation of art from the periods studied. The findings indicate that engaging with AI tools promotes critical thinking and creativity, which are crucial competencies in the study of art history. Survey data further suggest that the integration of AI in art history positively influences students’ perceptions of the discipline, aligning well with contemporary digital trends. One of the significant outcomes of the study is the varied experiences of students with AI tools. While some faced challenges with the technology, particularly in accurately capturing complex artwork details and crafting effective prompts, others found success in using AI to generate detailed and creative interpretations of historical pieces. These experiences underscore the potential of AI as a valuable pedagogical tool in art history and humanities education, offering novel insights into teaching methodologies.},

While GenAI potentially offers personalized learning, adaptive tutoring, and automated support, it also raises concerns about algorithmic bias, de-skilling educators, and diminishing human connection. This article examines these tensions by tracing the historical evolution of AI in education, revealing how early conceptual and terminological choices—such as the shift from cybernetics to artificial intelligence—have shaped current situations and debates. Through a comparative analysis of two contrasting AI-driven educational models—John Anderson’s structured cognitive tutoring systems and Seymour Papert’s constructionist approach emphasizing creative agency—we explore the enduring struggle between control and autonomy in learning. As GenAI becomes increasingly integrated into education, understanding these historical patterns offers critical insights into its future trajectory. Rather than viewing AI’s role in education as predetermined, we argue that thoughtful and informed decision-making will shape and determine whether these technologies will reinforce traditional structures or promote greater learner agency and creativity.},

It is of vital interest to determine how these applications will modify how the public perceives and interacts with history, as well as how history education is delivered. In this poster, we investigated academic historians’ practices and perceptions of integrating GenAI into their teaching. We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven historians who teach university-level courses. We identified the major concerns and perceived benefits of GenAI integration in history education, and some typical uses of GenAI in history classes. Our work contributes an important baseline assessment of attitudes and practices within the field so that we may better understand the existing gaps among academic historians and the extent of those gaps.},

	abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in education is increasingly recognized as a key driver of educational innovation. While extensive literature exists on the integration of AI technologies in educational settings, less emphasis has been placed on the critical role of teachers and their professional development needs. This study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers' use of AI technology in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional development opportunities and the demand for AI integration among teachers. Using PRISMA principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65\% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching, including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In contrast, only 35\% of the studies explored AI's role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of AI in education.},

In this review paper, we seek insights into three critical questions: (1) What are the primary categories of AI applications explored in the education field? (2) What are the predominant research topics and their key findings? (3) What is the status of major research design elements, including guiding theories, methodologies, and research contexts? A bibliometric analysis of 2,223 research articles followed by a content analysis of selected 125 papers reveals a comprehensive conceptual structure of the existing literature. The extant AIED research spans a wide spectrum of applications, encompassing those for adaptive learning and personalized tutoring, intelligent assessment and management, profiling and prediction, and emerging products. Research topics delve into both the technical design of education systems and the examination of the adoption, impacts, and challenges associated with AIED. Furthermore, this review highlights the diverse range of theories applied in the AIED literature, the multidisciplinary nature of publication venues, and underexplored research areas. In sum, this research offers valuable insights for interested scholars to comprehend the current state of AIED research and identify future research opportunities in this dynamic field.},

	abstract = {The use of standardized test formats in the assessment of historical competencies has recently come under severe criticism, especially in the United States, where standardized tests are particularly common. History researchers have argued that open-ended items are more appropriate for assessment. However, providing largescale evaluations of open-ended answers is time consuming and poses challenges regarding the objectivity, validity, and replicability of ratings. To address this issue, we investigated the extent to which computer-based evaluation methods are suitable for evaluating student answers by combining qualitative methods from history education research with quantitative, computer-based linguistic analyses. In two studies, we analyzed data from an intervention study in which 962 students (ninth graders) completed seven open-ended tasks. In Study 1, we investigated the extent to which task complexity could be predicted from the linguistic complexity of the students' answers. In Study 2, we conducted an automatic content assessment by aligning student answers with predefined target answers and compared automatic scores with human ratings that were based on an elaborate evaluation scheme we developed. In our first study, we identified several linguistic features of students’ answers that successfully predicted task complexity. In our second study, the correlations between manual and computational task scores were encouraging. However, our human interrater agreement left room for improvement and demonstrated the challenges of reliably applying explicit evaluation criteria to open tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate that the combination of qualitative methods from history education research and quantitative computational-linguistic analyses may support the large-scale evaluation of open tasks.},

In this article, we provide a review of existing AI systems in education and their pedagogic and educational assumptions. We develop a typology of AIED systems and describe different ways of using AI in education and learning, show how these are grounded in different interpretations of what AI and education is or could be, and discuss some potential roadblocks on the AIED highway.},

The authors propose seven approaches for utilizing AI in classrooms: AI-tutor, AI-coach, AI-mentor, AI-teammate, AI-tool, AI-simulator, and AI-student, each with distinct pedagogical benefits and risks. The aim is to help students learn with and about AI, with practical strategies designed to mitigate risks such as complacency about the AI's output, errors, and biases. These strategies promote active oversight, critical assessment of AI outputs, and complementarity of AI's capabilities with the students' unique insights. By challenging students to remain the "human in the loop," the authors aim to enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The proposed framework offers a guide for educators navigating the integration of AI-assisted learning in classrooms},
